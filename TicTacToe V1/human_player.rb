# The HumanPlayer class is responsible for holding information about the user and prompting them to enter a position for gameplay.

class HumanPlayer
    attr_reader :mark

# HumanPlayer#initialize(mark_value)
# # We'll allow a player to use any mark they like, so an instance of HumanPlayer should have a 
# # instance variable to store their mark. The value of this mark should be provided as an argument 
# # when creating a new player. Consider adding a getter method for the player's mark, this may be useful later!

    def initialize(value)
        @mark = value
    end

# HumanPlayer#get_position
# This method should prompt and allow the user to enter a valid row col position. 
# We recommend that you ask the user to enter the position as two numbers with a 
# space between them. Your method should return their entered position as an array 
# of the form [row, col] so that it is compatible with the design of our previous 
# Board methods. For usability, raise an error when they fail to enter a position 
# in the specified format, such as if they only enter a single number, use letters, 
# or have too many spaces.
# No need to verify if the position they entered is a valid position in this class. 
# That validation requires knowledge of the board and we want to keep our concerns separated. 
# Besides, you previously implemented that logic in Board#valid? and Board#empty?.
# It's also helpful if you state the player's mark when asking them to enter a move, so we know whose turn it is.
